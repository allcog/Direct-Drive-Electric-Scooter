# Direct Drive Electric Scooter

This was a final year Electrical Engineering honours project to convert a childrens electric scooter to an electric direct drive scooter. The project achieved a very positive result. Its operation can be seen in the video provided in the main repository directory. A detailed overview of the project can be found in the report directory. Shown below is the scooter before the project began and after.

## System Overview 

Although this project was very hardware orientated, the source code for the embedded systems component has been provided. The embedded system is based on a PIC microcontoller. In addition to interpeting the user input and control signals, it also relayed information to the rider as shown below.

The microcontrollers full role in the system can also be be seen in the following functional diagram.

## Schematics and PCB Layouts

In the embedded system directory, the schematics and PCB files can also be found. They are also shown below.

## Solid Modeling 

In order to fabricate the battery housing, much of the frame was modeled in solid works as can be seen below.
